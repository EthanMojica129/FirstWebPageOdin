# Tech Stack Used

I used:

 - HTML
 - CSS


# Project Result

A simple Static Page

# What did I learn / Refresh?

Although I already mastered perfectly HTML 5 and CSS 3 the reality is that sometimes it can be confusing the use of the elements to make a page responsive, so I used to make an analysis and a refresher of these concepts.
